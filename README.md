## Version

## Build
Run "make.cmd" on Windows or run "make" on Linux/MacOS and type "all" in the terminal  

## Install the content
Note: Normally installing the content from the ingame content installer is enough.

The mod expects the original Red Alert 2 game assets and original Yuri's Revenge assets in place. Put the .mix archives in the following directory depending on your operating system.

Windows: `My Documents\OpenRA\Content\yr\`  
Mac OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/OpenRA/Content/yr/`  
Linux: `~/.openra/Content/yr/`  
Create the `yr` directory if it does not exist.  

### Download  
The game can be bought and downloaded from the following official places:  
[EA Origin](https://www.origin.com/hkg/en-us/store/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-the-ultimate-collection)  
[XWIS](http://xwis.net/forums/index.php/topic/163831-how-to-play/)  

### Disc  
If you own the original CDs:  

Locate `Game1.CAB` on Original `Red Alert 2` CD in the `INSTALL/` directory.  
Copy all required mixes into your content folder.  
The mixes inside of `Game1.CAB` are `ra2.mix` and `language.mix`. Copy those two into your content folder.  
For the soundtrack you want `theme.mix` from your CD.  

Locate `Game6.CAB` on Original `Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge` CD in the `INSTALL/` directory.  
Copy all required mixes into your content folder.  
The mixes inside of `Game6.CAB` are `ra2md.mix` and `langmd.mix`. Copy those two into your content folder.
